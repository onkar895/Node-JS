       <h2>MongoDB:</h2>
             <ul>
                <li>MongoDB is a document-oriented database. It uses the concept of the document to store data, which is more flexible than the row concept in the relational database management system (RDBMS).</li>
                <li>MongoDB is a document database. It stores data in a type of JSON format called BSON.</li>
                <li>A record in MongoDB is a document, which is a data structure composed of key value pairs similar to the structure of JSON objects.</li>
                <li>Records in a MongoDB database are called documents, and the field values may include numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, or even nested documents.</li>
                <li>A document allows you to represent complex hierarchical relationships with a single record.</li>
                <li>MongoDB is a NoSQL (non-relational) database.</li>
                <li>NoSQL simply means a non-relational database i.e. there is no table-like relational database structure instead there is a totally different mechanism for storing and retrieving data.</li>
                <li>This format of storage is called BSON and is very much similar to JSON.</li>
                 <h2>Document database:</h2>
                <li>The document database fetches and accumulates data in forms of key-value pairs but here, the values are called as Documents. A document can be stated as a complex data structure. </li>
                <li>Document here can be a form of text, arrays, strings, JSON, XML, or any such format.</li>
                <li>The use of nested documents is also very common. It is very effective as most of the data created is usually in the form of JSON and is unstructured.</li>

                <h2>Terminologies: </h2>
                <li>A MongoDB Database can be called as the container for all the collections.</li>
                <li>Collection is a bunch of MongoDB documents. It is similar to tables in RDBMS.</li>
                <li>Document is made of fields. It is similar to a tuple in RDBMS, but it has dynamic schema here. Documents of the same collection need not have the same set of fields</li>
             </ul>

             <h2>SQL:  MySQL</h2>
             <ul>
                <li>TABLE</li>
                <li>ROWS</li>
                <li>COLUMNS</li>
             </ul>

             <h2>NoSQL : MongoDB </h2>
              <ul>
                <li>COLLECTIONS</li>
                <li>DOCUMENTS</li>
             </ul>

             <h2>Collections:</h2>
             <ul>
                <li>Each collection will be used to store particular kind of data.</li>
                <li>Collection is a bunch of MongoDB documents. It is similar to tables in RDBMS.</li>
                <h3>Types of collections:</h3>
                <li><strong> User Collection: </strong> User Collections will be used to store different kinf of users document. E.g: UserId, Username etc. </li>
                <li><strong> Blog Collection:</strong> In the Blog collections, we can have all the attributes and all the blog documents</li>
             </ul>

             <h2>Documents:</h2>
             <ul>
               <li>Document is made of fields. It is similar to a tuple in RDBMS, but it has dynamic schema here. Documents of the same collection need not have the same set of fields </li>
             </ul>

             <ul>
               <li>User Model: User.get(), User.searchuserbyid()</li>
               <li>Blog Model: Blog.name, Blog.Username</li>

             <h2>Working of MongoDB:</h2>
             <p>The following image shows how the MongoDB works:</p>

             <br>
             <h3>MongoDB work in two layers â€“</h3>
             <ul>
               <li> Application Layer and</li>
               <li> Data layer</li>

               <h2>Application Layer: </h2>
               <p>Application Layer is also known as the Final Abstraction Layer, it has two-parts, first is a Frontend (User Interface) and the second is Backend (server). 
                    The frontend is the place where the user uses MongoDB with the help of a Web or Mobile. This web and mobile include web pages, mobile applications, android default applications, IOS applications, etc. 
                    The backend contains a server which is used to perform server-side logic and also contain drivers or mongo shell to interact with MongoDB server with the help of queries.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Data Layer:</h2>
                    <p>These queries are sent to the MongoDB server present in the Data Layer. Now, the MongoDB server receives the queries and passes the received queries to the storage engine. 
                          MongoDB server itself does not directly read or write the data to the files or disk or memory. After passing the received queries to the storage engine, the storage engine is responsible to read or write the data in the files or memory basically it manages the data.</p>
             </ul>

             <h2>REQUESTS: </h2>
             <ul>
               <li><strong>GET: </strong>The client requests a resource on the web server</li>
               <li><strong>POST:</strong>The client submits data to a resourse on the web server</li>
               <li><strong>PUT:</strong>The client replaces the resource on the web server</li>
               <li><strong>DELETE:</strong>The client deletes the resource on the web server</li>
             </ul>
